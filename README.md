# Free Speech Project


The Free Speech Project is a collection of technologies making up a secure, P2P, encrypted, and (optionally) anonymous Internet. It is comprised of a series of NPM packages, and is currently a work-in-progress. The goal of this project is to make it easy for everyone to embed secure communications tools into their application, and later; to provide a web-based user interface for encrypted chat and social networking features.
